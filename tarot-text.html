      <h2>Tarot: a tool of self-knowledge</h2>
      <p>Tarot cards appeared between the 15th and 16th centuries in northern Italy, 
        and were created for a game of the same name, which was played by nobles and lords of 
        the most traditional houses in continental Europe.</p>
      <p>The Tarot is the object of study in the most diverse areas, being an instrument of study and use even by Psychology. 
        Carl Gustav Jung, renowned psychologist of the 20th century, spoke of Archetypes; images from the ancestral collective memory 
        that are within our unconscious minds and that can be activated by a certain Symbol, which invigorates and brings out all the 
        emotional charge that the image has in itself and that touches us deeply. Tarot cards are then seen as illustrations of 
        the yearnings of the human soul, a kind of comic book about our dramas.</p>
      <p>In addition, the interpretation of cards is considered a divinatory art called "cartomancy". 
        Advice is given, predictions are made, magic is practiced with the help of the cards and their meanings.</p>
